âœ… Step 1: Setup your project
Create a folder called password_manager/
Inside, create two files:

main.py â€“ where your Python code will go

secret.key â€“ this will be created by the code to store your encryption key

Weâ€™ll also use the cryptography library to encrypt/decrypt passwords:

Open terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install cryptography

#Step4: Create the GUI with Tkinter
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

#lets build the input fields.
root = tk.Tk()  # Create the main window
root.title("Password Manager")  # Set the title of the window

tk.Label(root, text ="Website:").grid(row=0, column=0)  # Label for website input
website_entry = tk.Entry(root, width=35) # Entry field for website
website_entry.grid(row=0, column=1, columnspan=2)   # Span two columns for the entry field

    #Step 7: Create buttons for saving and searching passwords
    tk.Button(root, text = "Save Password", command=save_password).grid(row=3, column=1)  # Button to save the password
    tk.Button(root, text = "Search Password", command=search_password).grid(row=3, column=2)  # Button to search for a password

    âœ… Final Structure to Try Yourself
I suggest you try building it in this order:

Generate and load the key.

Build encryption and decryption functions.

Create a simple GUI with one input and a save button.

Add save and search logic step-by-step.

Test after each feature you add.

ðŸš€ Ready to Try It Yourself?
You can:

Add a password generator button

Add master password protection

Export your saved data securely

Turn this into a .exe using pyinstaller
